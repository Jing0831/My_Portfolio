## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### ETH and S&P 500 Clustering Analysis

**Description:** For this Python based project, I collected historical trading data for S&P 500 companies and ETH-USD, and filtered 10,000 twitter posts, containing the words "ETH", "Ethereum". The project includes the following steps: collecting data,explore data, modify variables, setup model, and evaluate model. My hypothesis is that companies that are highly correlated will be affected by the same possitive or negative market information, and thus they should converge in market performance. I hope to find these companies.<br>

## Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or was just having fun with.

### ACCT and Financial Reporting
**Description:** This repository contains the course materials and my final exam on the CVS Annual Financial Report for a 5 month ACCT and Fiancial Reporting course.<br>
**Repository:** A comprehensive overview of the basic financial statements and how they and other accounting information are utilized for managerial decision making in a global economy. Topics include, but are not limited to, financial reporting and analysis, profit analysis, planning and forecasting, and cost control.  Environmental factors and ethical implications are integrated throughout the course.---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/Jing0831/ACCT-and-Financial-Reporting.git)<br>

## Certificates [Live and Learn]
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result.‚ú®<br>
I gained a very systematic knowledge of statistics and analytical skills and graduated with honors with a 4.0 GPA in both my MBA degree and MS degree.<br/>
üíûÔ∏è Here is a list of my transcript and my certificates:

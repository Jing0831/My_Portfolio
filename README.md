## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### ETH and S&P 500 Clustering Analysis

**Description:** For this Python based project, I collected historical trading data for S&P 500 companies and ETH-USD, and filtered 10,000 twitter posts, containing the words "ETH", "Ethereum". The project includes the following steps: collecting data,explore data, modify variables, setup model, and evaluate model. My hypothesis is that companies that are highly correlated will be affected by the same possitive or negative market information, and thus they should converge in market performance. I hope to find these companies.<br>

## Certificates [Live and Learn]
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result.‚ú®<br>
I gained a very systematic knowledge of statistics and analytical skills and graduated with honors with a 4.0 GPA in both my MBA degree and MS degree.<br/>
